# 🍷 + 🍱 = Vinz.

## ⚡️ About
I love to cook with friends, to try unknown recipes every time and taste delicious new wines with them.

Getting inspiration, however, is often cumbersome and time-consuming - as a layperson, choosing a suitable wine for a dish is difficult. 
That gave me the idea for my app.
