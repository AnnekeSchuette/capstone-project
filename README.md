## About ‚ö°Ô∏è

> I love to cook with friends and try out new recipes and wines with them. For me it's the perfect way to share conviviality, pleasure and creativity. <br />
> Getting inspiration, however, is often cumbersome and time-consuming - as a layperson, choosing a suitable wine for a dish is difficult. <br /><br />
> That gave me the idea for this app, which is my digital capstone project for the _neueFische_ **web development bootcamp**.<br />

_hint: This gives you the source code of the app. Unfortunately you will need to request an API key from spoonacular.com to use the full functionality of this App when cloning the repository. You can set your API key via environmental variable or directly exchange it in the services files. Also you need to setup a MongoDB to save journal entries. Configure as you desire!_ üë©üèª‚Äçü¶∞‚úåüèª
