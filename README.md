## About ⚡️ 
> I love to cook with friends, to try unknown recipes every time and taste delicious new wines with them.<br />
> Getting inspiration, however, is often cumbersome and time-consuming - as a layperson, choosing a suitable wine for a dish is difficult. <br /><br />
> That gave me the idea for this app, which is my digital capstone project for the _neueFische_ **web development bootcamp**.<br />
