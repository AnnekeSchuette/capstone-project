      'Souffle can be paired with Bordeaux, Champagne, and White Burgundy. French wine is just as diverse as French food, but you rarely go wrong with champagne. If your meal calls for a white wine, you might also try a white burgundy. For a red, try a red bordeaux blend. The Chateau Pindefleurs St-Emilion Bordeaux with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 22 dollars per bottle.',
